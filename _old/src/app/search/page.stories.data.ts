          'Santa Claus, Indiana, acquired its famous name in 1856 and has been celebrating the spirit of Christmas ever since. Postmaster James Martin began answering children s letters to Santa and his elves in 1914, a tradition that continues to this day and makes Santa Claus a favored destination for those seeking the holiday spirit. The town s unique name prompted Robert Ripley to feature it in his popular cartoon strip, and businessmen such as Carl Barrett and Milton Harris raced to erect Christmas attractions as early as 1935. Beating Walt Disney by nearly a decade, Louis J. Koch opened Santa Claus Land, the nation s first theme park, in 1946. Today, visitors still flock to Santa Claus to share in the magic of America s Christmas Hometown. "',

        description:
          'Much of the modern-day vision of Santa Claus is owed to the Clement Moore poem "The Night Before Christmas." His description of Saint Nicholas personified the "jolly old elf" known to millions of children throughout the world. However, far from being the offshoot of Saint Nicholas of Turkey, Santa Claus is the last of a long line of what scholars call "Wild Men" who were worshipped in ancient European fertility rites and came to America through Pennsylvania\'s Germans. This pagan creature is described from prehistoric times through his various forms--Robin Hood, The Fool, Harlequin, Satan and Robin Goodfellow--into today\'s carnival and Christmas scenes. In this thoroughly researched work, the origins of Santa Claus are found to stretch back over 50,000 years, jolting the foundation of Christian myths about the jolly old elf.',

        description:
          'Christmas is approaching and a young boy, Joey, was asked by his grandma what he was going to ask Santa for this Christmas. Joey said he hadn\'t made up his mind as yet. Later, Joey goes with his parents and sister to their local downtown Christmas parade. Floats and marching bands of all descriptions were entertaining. One particular float had a local church choir singing the song of "The Little Drummer Boy." A little boy with the choir was seen miming, not actually playing his drum. Joey immediately noticed this, and asked his dad about that. Dad could only assume that the little boy could not actually play. Later, mother took Joey and his sister to the local mall to do some Christmas shopping. They were greeted at the mall, with a choir singing Christmas songs and carols. They stopped and listened a while as the choir started to sing the song, The "Little Drummer Boy". This was the same choir from the Downtown Christmas parade, with the same little boy miming his drum. Close by was a table with books for sale and a banner reading, "St. Michael\'s Church Choir". The choir was trying to raise money for a trip to Rome and the Vatican next year, as their choir had been invited to perform before the Pope, performing their version of, "The Little Drummer Boy" song, as an international gesture of good will. Joey approached the table and asked, "How come, the drummer with the choir isn\'t actually playing?" It was explained; so far they had no luck finding a young boy who could play well enough. So, for the time-being, they had to put up with a mime. Ecstatic, Joey asked if he could get to be good enough, would he be allowed to try out. The girl gave Joey the choir director\'s name and telephone number and said, "Give him a call." Later that evening, Joey asked his Dad to help him write a letter to Santa, asking for a drum, because he now had discovered what he really wanted the most from Santa this Christmas. Not only that, but he now had a \'good reason\'; to play his drum for Jesus, just like the original drummer boy did. The story goes on to tell how Santa received this special request and the putting together of a drum to fulfill the special request.',

          "Glaciers Melt & Mountains Smoke - Calamity! Disaster! Santa Claus' beloved world is crashing down around him. In the third book of The Santa Claus Trilogy, the North Pole is melting, and the buildings of his magical workshop are punching through the last remnants of ice, plunging into the Arctic Ocean. Santa has to save the operation and its inhabitants, including his wife and sons. Making things worse, Santa faces a cyber bullying attack, and he must deal with this at the same time as moving the North Pole Workshops. Santa will need all his elves, family, and people he has helped before to help him accomplish everything in time. But can he do it before this disaster swallows the village? Discussions with the Author What is The Santa Claus Trilogy? The SC Trilogy is a three-part series that is a family read for everyone from preteen kids reading chapter books to the eldest great grand-parent. It answers a great many mysteries and legends about Santa Claus while entertaining the reader with imaginative fantasies and real events of the world. Is this book only about Christmas? Glaciers Melt takes place well before the holidays of Christmas. Much of the action takes place in spring and summer before all is lost. And if Santa is going to continue his work, everything needs to be in place before Christmas comes again. What is the order of the books? Believe Again, The North Pole Chronicles is the first book in the series. Faith, Hope & Reindeer is the second in the series. Glaciers Melt and Mountains Smoke is the third in the series. Also related: The Faces of Krampus, which is the story of Black Peter, the assistant to St. Nicholas. Aeon Millennium, The Time-Traveling Elf, is set to be released in Fall, 2018. Can readers get the whole series in one bundle? You may purchase The Santa Claus Trilogy as a collection containing all three books in the box set. So, why should readers give these books a try? Santa and the North Pole Village now face becoming the next Atlantis and disappearing into the sea. Somehow the residents and animals of the polar ice cap must relocate before everything is lost. But move to where, and how? After several hundred years where can they retreat and find the peace and secrecy they had for centuries? Imagination and wonder are hallmarks of an intelligent mind, and this book is a fertile ground to plant these qualities. The third book in The Santa Claus Trilogy brings all the elements of the first two books and shows what is achievable when everyone works together. This book is a great addition for teachers and homeschooling, especially as it addresses cyber bullying",

Mean-spirited and bratty, eight-year-old Nicholas Claus causes townspeople to shake their heads at his antics. But one day, the evil trolls, led by the Ice Queen, invade the village and capture Nicholas. He has something the Ice Queen and Troll King want. Young Nicholas is no match for the King and Queen and their thousands of trolls. But, fortunately, Nicholas has a lot of help coming his way. His sister, Shelby, and friends Madison and Rett Kringle are determined to rescue Nicholas, as is Prince Hero, Alpine City's savior. God has also sent the guardian angel Walter to watch over Nicholas, Shelby, and the Kringles as they battle the forces of evil. Santa Claus: The Spirit of Christmas combines traditional Christmas characters including Santa Claus, Frosty, and Rudolph with the true meaning of Christmas and the birth of Jesus Christ. This fantasy-adventure story chronicles the childhood years of young Nicholas Claus and recalls the events that unfold to inspire him to become the famous Christmas icon.",

          "Sarah Buttons, Master Doll Maker Cuddly animals and action figures and baby dolls, oh my! Where would Santa be if he didn't have tons of these at Christmas? Well, thankfully because of Sarah Buttons, he need not concern himself with that problem. Sarah is our Master Doll Maker, and she creates all kinds of dolls, stuffed animals, a variety of heroes, soldiers, and so much more. With lyrical rhymes, adorable pictures, and a delightful storyline, Sarah is bound to be a favorite tale of your child's, year after year. Santa reminds us that we should always be grateful for everything in our lives. It is reasonable and proper to desire more in life, but we should never forget to give thanks for what we already have. Santa's message is at the end of the story. About Santa's Elf Series© by the author, Joe Moore: Even as I was writing the first novel in the Santa Claus Trilogy, I envisioned an entire world at the top of the globe. I knew the most die-hard believer in Santa Claus would realize that this magical gift-giver would need assistance in achieving his task at Christmas. So I began to think about who these helpers were, and what their responsibilities to Santa might be. Then I started writing. And to my surprise, as I wrote, the stories came out of me in rhyme! The cadence and beat of the verses were lyrical. As I spoke to others, including a good many teachers and librarians, they told me this was the easiest way for children to learn and that I should keep the verses coming. As Santa, I also heard from parents about their frustrations trying to instruct their children in the primary lessons of life; such as picking up after themselves, being polite, sharing, brushing their teeth, and so on. So I put a special message from Santa Claus at the end of each story about each of these lessons. Even complex problems like bullying, showing gratitude, and listening to elders get addressed in these books. It never hurts to learn these lessons throughout the year. I wrote nearly 20 books in this series, each focusing on a particular elf and their role to Santa. My wife and illustrator, Mary, is doing her best to get these magical tales drawn and into your child's hands. Since she works so hard fully illustrating every page and includes elements like shapes, colors, and even geography, it takes her a little while to complete each book. We have a half dozen released and more “in the works.” I have already heard about new traditions started during Christmas with my Santa Claus Trilogy and families. I am hoping that these will also become part of your celebrations. Make Santa's Elf Series© a new tradition for your family and collect the entire series. The following is a list of the currently published books in the series: Santa's World, Introducing Santa's Elf Series Jamie Hardrock, Chief Mining Elf Shelley Wrapitup, Master Design Elf Keeney Eagleye, Naughty/Nice List Manager Sarah Buttons, Master Dollmaker Ford MacHarley, Master Wheelsmith",

          "Since 1959, Santaas Village in Dundee has entertained millions. The park was born of a man who as a child had no real Christmas. Glenn Holland grew up in California during the Great Depression. His parents died by the time he was 18 years old, leaving him to care for his younger sister. As a father, he tried to give his own children the type of Christmas that he only knew in his dreams. In the early 1950s, struck with inspiration, Holland sat at his kitchen table one day and started to sketch his idea for a Christmas fairyland where all the magic of the holiday would come to life: Santaas Village. Holland and general contractor Putnam Henck built three Santaas Villages, two in California and one in Dundee.",

The perfect Christmas gift, this beautiful book explains how the bearded, red clad, big bellied, reindeer driving jovial gent came to be the face of Christmas, and reveals the historical origins of Saint Nicholas over seventeen hundred years ago in the Eastern Roman Empire. In a winding, magical tale filled with mystery and good will towards all men, Joseph McCullough travels across Europe (and the North Pole... of course) to uncover the exploits of Santa in a book that is sure to fill even the most jaded scrooges with a little bit of Christmas magic. And for any nervous parents out there – don't worry, there are no Father Christmas 'spoilers' between the pages of this book – ensuring the wonderous children's whisperings of Santa will continue... for another couple of years at least!",

Frank Baum imagines the life of Santa Claus as only he could. From his childhood in the enchanted Forest of Burzee to his time in the Laughing Valley—where he invents the first toy as a gift for his neighbor’s child—Santa’s singular journey through life reveals how he became the iconic figure of joy and generosity we all know and love. As we travel along with him, we learn many of Santa’s secrets—from the reason he slides down chimneys to how he makes his famous annual trip around the world in a single night. We also learn the origins of popular traditions, such as decorating Christmas trees and hanging stockings. A beloved tale of fantasy, adventure, and spirit, The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus is a truly classic piece of children’s literature.",

          "Excerpt from Santa Claus on a Lark: And Other Christmas Stories On a certain twenty-fourth day of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, if you had been looking in at the front windows of the Merchants' and Manufacturers' Bank, in the city of Smokopolis, you would have seen a big book, lying open on a desk, shut itself up with a sounding smack, spring into the air, and go flying to its place on the shelf of the vault in the rear of the counting-room. While you were wondering what might be the matter with the big book, you would suddenly discover that its remarkable antics were due to the agency of a little man whom you had hardly noticed before, whose chubby hands had closed the book, lifted it above his head, and borne it swiftly to its resting-place.

Now, in the attempt of easing human suffering, he, with the help of his imortal friends, will have to face the forces of evil and of resignation, in order to bring joy to the children and teach them, for the sake of humanity, the importance of sharing and caring for each other.",

          "He's a symbol of hope and hapiness, of generosity and benevolence. Santa Clause is simply one of the most beloved legends ever embraced. The Story of Santa explores the history of Father Christmas. Who is he, really? Where did he come from? (His origins may surprise you!) Why does he fulfill our wishes? And what can we learn from him? He's become a ubiquitous figure during the Christmas season with his white beard, red suit, and prominent belly, but just how much do those celebrating the happy holiday really know about Santa Claus? Here is the whole story from the beginning—including the pre-Santas like Sinterklaas, Father Christmas, and of course, St. Nicholas. This beautifully illustrated book celebrates all things Santa ranging from the much-loved poem \"The Night Before Christmas\" to the songs, movies, images, and stories that are loved by both young and old. Along the way, it explores the favorite stories that have sprung up around him, including Santa’s elves, his workshop, Santa’s beloved reindeer and the legend of Mrs. Claus and the North Pole abode where she and her husband make their home. You'll even learn the secret to how Santa has time to visit every house around the world in just one night (a mathematician explains how it’s physically possible).",

At the other side stands a terrible mountain that contains the caves of the daemons: Selfishness, Envy, Hatred, and Repentance. The daemons, thinking they have great cause to dislike old Santa, enact a treacherous plan on Christmas Eve. Then, with Santa curiously absent, only Santa's magical friends can save Christmas! A comic adaptation retelling the classic Christmas tale of adventure and danger.",

While not always politically correct, it's always honest. This book evokes laughter, smiles, tears and may even take your breath away. Ever wonder why Santa is so jolly? Read this book. Ever wonder what children ask for for Christmas? Read this book. Santa knows what children want for Christmas, sometimes before the children do. Enjoy this light hearted look into the minds of the children as Santa Claus not only answers their questions but poses questions of his own to the kids. Delightful, brilliant, touching, a real tear jerker and I laughed so hard while reading are all comments Santa has received on his book. This second version is unillustrated but just as delightful as the first issue. Santa's elves have also corrected some of his earlier formatting errors as well. Please enjoy. Santa",
